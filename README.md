## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any
contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.
To collect, prioritise and work on issues in a collaborative fashion we have established
some [contribution guidelines](https://miranum.com/docs/components/contributing) as well as
a [GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/Miragon/projects/11).
Please make sure to read through these guidelines before starting with your contribution.

### PRs for every change

All changes have to be done in a separate Branch or Fork (if you are an external contributor). As soon as the changes
are
done please open a PR. A GitHub Action runs with every commit to a Branch and checks if the documentation can be built.
If you create a new branch make sure to name it according to what it does (e.g. feat/xyz or fix/xyz). Please use
semantic
commit messages as described in [here](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716).

### Code reviews

We are using simple emoji's to help convey intention and added meaning in code review comments. A little bit of emoji
can
go a long way when it comes to code reviews and make giving and receiving code review a little bit more enjoyable.
We are following this [guide by erikthedeveloper](https://github.com/erikthedeveloper/code-review-emoji-guide).
